For data source used json file on GitHub Gist

The ids of the selected stations are stored locally (SharedPreferences) and the objects are temporarily stored to display full information about them (Hive). The second is a temporary solution, because it is not known what the data source will be in the full version, and it may be changed there.

AutoRoute is used for navigation, animations are made in the form of TransitionsBuilders.slideLeftWithFade

All application logic is implemented using BLoC.
